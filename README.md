### Giovanni Organtini
Physics Professor at <a href=http://uniroma1.it>Sapienza Universit√† di Roma</a><br>
Affiliated to: <a href='http://home.cern'>CERN</a>, <a href='http://www.infn.it'>INFN</a>, <a href='https://www.aapt.org/'>AAPT</a>, <a href='https://icom.museum/en/'>ICOM</a>, <a href='https://www.sif.it/'>SIF</a>

I work for the <a href='https://cms.cern/detector'>CMS experiment</a> at CERN and for the <a href='http://padme.lnf.infn.it/'>PADME</a> experiment at LNF. I contributed to the design and the building of the e.m. calorimeter of the CMS experiment, who dsicovered the Higgs boson in 2012.

My activity is now focused on physics education. 

1. [''Fondamenti di Fisica''](https://www.pearson.it/opera/pearson/0-7110-fondamenti_di_fisica?iesError=login_required&iesErrorDescription=Login+required), by J. Walker, is the italian edition of a physics textbook by Walker. I reviewed it added videolectures about home made physics experiments using Arduino or smartphones. In the new italian edition, in particular, I paid much attention to safety aspects and gender equality.
2. [''Fisica con Arduino''](https://online.scuola.zanichelli.it/fisicaconarduino/), Zanichelli, is a textbook for schools in which I describes simple experiments to be done with Arduino.
3. [''Physics experiments with Arduino and smartphones''](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030651398), published by Springer, is a university textbook about laboratory practice, statistical data analysis and introduces to python programming.

My interests are in the following topics.

1. Quantum mechanics (QM): a new kind of introduction, overcoming the traditional one as the consequence of a crisis of classical mechanics. In my view, QM can be introduced as a natural extension of classical mechanics, provided few classical concepts are appropriately taught.
2. Coding: introducing coding in physics education is a must. I consider C-language as very effective in coding education. On the other hand Python appears simpler and more flexible. Merging coding and experimental activities is fundamental.
3. Physics, mathematics and art relationships.
